PECAN members may include any individual who self identifies as an early career academic working within the school of (or broader topic areas covered by) psychological sciences. To ensure clear communication between school committees and ECAs, PECAN has several committee representatives who attend and report on occurrences in key school committees and meetings, such as the MSPS research and research training sub-committee, the monthly school meeting, monthly hub meetings, the Faculty level early career researcher network, external relations committee, and the learning and teaching sub-committee. A gerneral committee including events coordinator, mentorship convenors, Hub Represntatives, and an OH&S representative, will be established as the organization grows. Diversity is a priority in the make-up of PECAN ECA committees.

These issues are not unique to the school or university. PECAN aims to work with the Research Hubs, School of Psychological Sciences and the University of Melbourne to address these issues. The more supported our young researchers are, the more likely they will go on to innovative research, teaching and industry careers that benefit everyone. PECAN Peer-Networking issues ECAs do not know how to contact one another, who other ECAs are, and are not notified when ECAs enter or leave the school. ECAs cannot easily connect with other peers, limiting their ability to seek advice, mentorship, or hear about the experiences of other ECAs. ECAs entering MSPS do not have a school-based point of contact that can answer questions related to conducting research or teaching in the school as an ECA, living and working in Melbourne, and building social networks within and outside of the university. There are ECA resources provided by the Faculty that could be accessed if they were made available in a space MSPS ECAs know to access. ECAs often pursue similar career goals, such as grants and awards, however, do not have a readily accessible collection of resources and materials from which to learn. This disadvantages ECAs who don\u2019t have an established peer network from which to request such materials. These resources could be volunteered and made available (anonymously, if required) in a centralized repository accessible by all ECAs, increasing the likelihood of ECAs achieving career milestones, such as obtaining grants and awards. School and PECAN issues ECAs do not have a centralized point of information sharing. Therefore, decisions made by committees, schools, the Faculty, and external networks such as the Early Career Researcher Network, cannot be easily communicated. ECAs are among the most unlikely to voice their concerns at school or hub meetings. Their contracts are often short and insecure. Furthermore, with relatively few ECAs present in the school, ECAs lack anonymity in raising their concerns and could benefit from a collective body that ensures their anonymity while still having their voices heard. ECAs predominantly seek career advice from their supervisors. However, supervisors may be providing advice based on out-of-date experience. With grant and job requirements updated almost yearly, ECAs need to know what to prioritize (e.g., public outreach, teaching) to succeed in today\u2019s job market and/or grant systems, and the school needs to support ECAs in meeting these requirements. School, Hub, and Committee issues ECAs often need to show teaching experience, specifically lecturing experience, when applying for continuing contracts. Guest lecturing is the best way to gain this experience. However, guest lecturing from ECA\u2019s is not prioritized in MSPS courses. Job descriptions for ECAs generally allocate 100% of their time to research or teaching roles. ECAs are intentionally not included on committees to protect this time, however, this decision may harm their ability to show leadership skills when going for future jobs and grants. ECA time must remain protected, however, voluntary ECA positions could be made available on key committees to ensure leadership opportunities and information sharing among PECAN. ECAs interact with and receive support from their respective Hubs to differing degrees, with many not knowing how to interact with their hubs productively. ECAs could interact with hubs more effectively in two capacities: leadership roles & collaborations. Leadership roles: ECAs may advance their leadership, teaching, and career-building by running voluntary hub workshops (in their own, and in other hubs). This would also make ECAs accessible to Ph.D. and future Ph.D. students, affording opportunities for mentorship or future supervision. Collaborations: ECAs may form ECA-led collaborations that use the resources from one or more Hubs collaboratively.

Although writing processes like Microsoft Word are often the default among academics, modern alternatives eixst that help you write quickly and format documents to Journal Specifications. Prime among these is Overleaf , a LaTeX scripting language that formats your document (page layout, citation style, title page, heading styles, figure placements, everything!) to a Journal's specifications all through a few simple commands. If you find LaTeX source code intimidating, Overleaf also has a Rich Text Editor (like Microsoft Word) to make transitioning to LaTeX just that bit easier. Overleaf is free to use, hosted online so you can work on your paper from anywhere, and if you signup using your university staff email, you will have access to all of its paid-for features, such as track changes, commenting, and git-hub integration. Google docs TBD. Analysis Tools SPSS SPSS is a powerful statistical and data management software package that uses a graphical user interface and supports an internal coding language for advanced analyses. SPSS is widely used and taught in many undergraduate psychology courses and is useful for data cleaning, analysis, and basic graphics and plotting (but not APA style!). The University currently has a site licence for SPSS, however, the program is not free to use otherwise. If you plan to share your analyses with collaborators on in online repositories, it may be better to use an open-source analysis alternative, such as JASP or JAMOVI. SAS: Statistical Analysis Software SAS is a broad statistical and analytical program. It allows you to manage data, data mine, graphics and statistical analysis. The user interface is designed for researchers and has several components that deal with analysis and data reporting. SAS comes with a lot of online support, has consultants who work at the University, and is a staple of many undergraduate courses. For beginners the user interface is not the easiest to work, with a terminal more similar to a coding lagnuage like R, but SAS does have a large range of capabilities and can be a good place to start learning more advanced coding (as opposed to point-and-click) analysis techniques. It is a popular alternative to SPSS, and is considered better for handling large databases. SAS has a university site licence and is avalible through the university for all operating systems on computers owned by the University or for download on your personal computer. Online courses can be accessed through the SAS website . JASP - Just Another Stat Program JASP is a free to use Stastistical package designed for Psychology Researchers by the University of Amsterdam and an excellent substitute for graphical user interface programs, such as SPSS. JASP carries out both Frequentist (p-value) and Bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, recevies regular updates, refreshes results in real-time (no more running & re-running results from scratch!) and is a growing part of many undergraduate statistical courses. If you wish to move away from the costly fees and non-APA formated results of SPSS but don't wish to learn a new analysis language like R or python, then try JASP. JAMOVI JAMOVI is a free to use Statistical software that aims to bridge the gap between researchers and statisticans. Many advanced statistical methods are being made by mathematical psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and statisticans, but are only avalible through the open-source langage of R. JAMOVI integrates with R to make these resources avalible in a Graphical User Interface (e.g., JASP, SPSS) that psychological researchers are more familar with. Similar to JASP, JAMOVI performs analyses in real-time (no waiting or re-running scripts), performs both frequentist and bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, is regularly updated, and is receiving support through university and online courses. Where JAMOVI differes from JASP is that all analyses are actually performed in R with the code accessible to the researcher in-real-time. In fact, you can run your JAMOVI R-script in R to get the exact same results. If learning to code is on your to-do list, and you're not sure where to start, consider the free-to-use JAMOVI. Stata Stata is a complete, integrated statistical package that provides tools for data analysis, data management, and graphics. Stata can be used for standard methods and advanced techniques, such as survival models with frailty, dynamic panel data (DPD) regressions, generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel mixed models, models with sample selection, multiple imputation, ARCH, and estimation with complex survey samples. STATA generates publication-quality graphs, including regression fit graphs, time-series graphs, survival plots, and contour plots. Stata may be useful for anyone looking to carry out more advanced modelling through a graphical user interface, however, no university wide licence currently exists. If you need to access Stat, it is avalible on two computeres on the 10th floor of the Redmond Barry Building (near the lockers). Due to the issue of accessiblity and cost, it is strongly recommended academics consider the other analysis tools avalible on this list. Coding Languages Find tools that help you learn coding langauges that are needed in Academic and industy jobs. Key languages include Python, Matlab, R, C and C++, and Javascript. Python Python is the coding language of choice in many industry and academic jobs. The language is designed first and foremost for readability - good python code is understandable with very little expertise - and second, for speed. Python and its many open-source libraries is excellent for a host of purposes, including data management, machine learning, site building, experimentation (e.g., psychopy & pygame), database integration, webscraping, figure plotting, and much more. Python is often recommended as a resarchers first language and due to its extreme flexability, is a highly desirable skillset in both academic and industry jobs. Psychopy Psychopy is a free graphical user interface for building online and inlab experiments. Simple experiments can be programed in Psychopy though a drag-and-drop style experimental-timeline interface, while more advanced experiments, sequences, and stimuli can be programed in base-python. Psychopy uses many functions adapted from the popular experimental and game building library, pygame, making it easy for experienced pygame users to quickly modify and extend existing psychpy experiments. If you're building your first experiment in python and don't want to jump straight into coding from sctach, psychopy is a great place to start. Matlab Matlab is a proprietary coding language designed for and by engineers, that received enormous backing and package development by psychophysicists, cognitive scientists and neuroscientists in the 1990's - 2010's, and is still popular today. Matlab is a grphical user interface desigend to take advantage of matrix math and matrix manipulation to quickly perform large-scale computations, and comes with many useful packages, such as the Psychtoolbox and Psychophysics Toolbox for precise response-time experimentation, the Image Processing Toolbox for fMRI and EEG visualization, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for machine learning, and the Eyelink Toolbox for eye-tracking data. The University of Melbourne has a site licence for Matlab and the software can be accessed on campus or downloaded to your personal computer. GNU Octave GNU Octave is the most well known alternative to Matlab. If you are familar with Matlab and are looking for a free alternative, consider using GNU Octave. R & Rstudio R and the associated graphical user interface Rstudio , is a staple of the open-science movment in neuroscience, social and cognitive psychology. R has a long history in psychology and was made noticably accessible with the free publication 'Learning Statistics with R' , an extremely accessible textbook by prominent Cognitive Scientist, Danielle Navaro. This textbook coveres everything from learning the basics of coding, to t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs and Bayesian statistical analysis. If you don't know where to start, try Learning Statistics with R. R offers an incredibly flexable statistical language with easy-to-download open-source packages that can perform advanced statistical techniques as designed by world leading scientists. These packages are often designed for and by psychological scientists and science communicators, meaning popular packages such as Tidyverse and GGplot are designed with ease-of-use and clear communication in mind. Because R is a free software, the langauge does not have the same assurances (e.g., backwards compatability, packages maintainance with major updates) as paid softwares, such as Matlab. However, R has an incredibly active scientific community that ensures bread-and-butter analysis packages (e.g., tidyverse, GGplot) are well maintained, and new analysis techniques (e.g., heirarchical Bayesian modelling, partical sampling techniques, social network analyses) are always being added. If you are after a flexable statistical langauge with access to cutting edge psychological analysis techniques, R might be for you. Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a relativly new form of R document that allows researchers to write their analyses and text in the same file (similar to a word file with embedded and usable code). Rmarkdown makes writing tutorials increadibly easy and intiutive, allows you to share your preliminary results with collaborators in a way where the method, code and results are clearly shown all in one place, and can be hosted online as an html or pdf document for ease-of-sharing. WorkflowR WorkflowR (pronounced workflower) is an Rmarkdown framework for reproducible and collaborative data science. WorkflowR allows you to write an Rmarkdown document and upload the results in real time through a git-lab or git-hub repository, posting the report online for collaborators to see immediately. If you are working on an international project, if you want to publish your results in real time (e.g., survey results during the COVID-19 pandemic), if you want to share your findings with your supervisor or collaborators as you go, then WorkflowR might be exactly what you're looking for.
