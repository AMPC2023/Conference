Abstracts Abstract submssions for AMPC 2023 will open closer to the conference date. Awards The Australian Mathematical Psychology Society is offering two awards as part of AMPC 2023 this year. These awards and nomination requirements are presented below: Douglas Vickers Outstanding Presentation Awards The Australian Society for Mathematical Psychology presents annual awards for the most outstanding presentations at the Australasian Mathematical Psychology Conference. The award category is named after Douglas Vickers, in recognition of his founding role in the field of mathematical psychology, both globally and in Australia. Eligibility, nomination, and selection Any conference presentation is eligible and all co-authors will be included as award recipients. Winners need not be members of the Australian Society for Mathematical Psychology. The number of awards offered and the selection of winners will be determined by a special committee appointed by the Executive Committee. The winners will be announced at the Australasian Mathematical Psychology Conference. John Keats Early Career Award The Australian Society for Mathematical Psychology (ASMP) presents an annual award for exceptional contributions (research, education, and/or service and leadership) in the field of mathematical psychology by an early career investigator. The investigator must be a member of the Australian Society for Mathematical Psychology. The award is named after John Keats, in recognition of his foundational role in establishing mathematical psychology in Australia. Eligibility, nomination, and selection The John Keats Early Career Award is given for exceptional contributions to the field of mathematical psychology by an early career researcher. \"Early career researcher\" is intended to include individuals who are either students or are no more than 10 years beyond the Ph.D. on the nomination deadline (excluding any career interruptions). The award is to be given for contributions in the field of mathematical psychology, including two or more of the following academic activities: Research: an outstanding body of research that has made a demonstrable impact on psychological theory, research methods, translation and/or application Education: an outstanding portfolio of teaching and/or mentoring in mathematical psychology Service and Leadership: service, external engagement, and leadership endeavours that have substantially benefited, applied, or promoted the field of mathematical psychology both within Australia and globally. The nominee must be a member of the ASMP and can self-nominate with endorsement from a member of either the ASMP or the Society for Mathematical Psychology. The winner will be selected by a special committee appointed by the Executive Committee; the selection committee normally is chaired by the Society's President. The winner will be announced at the Australasian Mathematical Psychology Conference. The recipient will be invited to make a presentation at a future meeting of the Society. Nominations should be sent via e-mail no later than Nov 15th each year. Nominations should include the following as PDFs (minimum 2cm margins and text no smaller than Arial Narrow size 10 font): A one-page summary of evidence of the outcomes and impact of the contributions of the nominee, addressing at least two of the three activities: Research, Education, and Service and Leadership. Nominees must specify the desired weighting for each type of activity (must sum to 100%) and must include at least two of the activity types with a weighting each of 10% or more (e.g., [90% Research; 10% Service and Leadership], or [50% Research; 30% Education; 20% Service and Leadership]) A current CV (maximum 2 pages), including only the top 10 publications. Ph.D. conferral date must be reported, if applicable A recommendation letter (maximum 1 page) from a member of either the ASMP or the Society for Mathematical Psychology If relevant, a summary of any career interruptions, as permitted for grants managed by the Australian Research Council (maximum 1/2 page). Nominees can only win the award once. Previously unsuccessful nominees may re-nominate. Nominations will open from Nov 1st each year.","title":"Registration & Abstracts"},{"location":"Registration/#registration","text":"Registraton details for AMPC 2023 will become available closer to the conference date.","title":"Registration"},{"location":"Registration/#abstracts","text":"Abstract submssions for AMPC 2023 will open closer to the conference date.","title":"Abstracts"},{"location":"Registration/#awards","text":"The Australian Mathematical Psychology Society is offering two awards as part of AMPC 2023 this year.
